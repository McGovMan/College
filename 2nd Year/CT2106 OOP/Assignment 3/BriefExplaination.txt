The idea of the assignment is to practice inheritance.

The bird and fish class inherit from the animal class.
So for example: the Bird class has a method called move which will print out a string coresponding
to whether the the bird can move or not. The ostrich class inherits this method.
When we call the method, it checks whether the animal can fly or not. As we have
set the ostrich to not be able to fly, the method instead prints out that it will
walk the distance instead.
