The whole point of the assignment is to inheritance.
Shark & Trout inherit from the Fish class, Ostrich & Canary inherit from the Bird class.
The The Bird & Fish classes inherit from Animal. This is done to stop lots of duplication of code.

Each class has toString method that is used to print out information on the animal and an equal method which is used to check if two objects are the same.

Test1 creates an array of animal objects and prints out information on the animals, such as their features.
Test2 creates an array of animal objects and compares all objects to each other using a for loop, and then prints to the screen if they match with the position of both objects in the array.
