Part 1:
Inside the public class:
- The res variable is set to the hash of the input. If the input is not
- The if statement first checks if the input given is long enough and that one was given.

Inside the hashing method:
- The hash method gets passed in the input and determines if it is a valid input.
- Once the has function deems it valid, it concatenates filler onto s and then clips sIn down to 64 characters.
- The for loop takes one of the 4 positions in the array hashA, it takes the position in the string multiples it by a random number, then the answer is added to the number in the array.
- Each number in the array is then modueled by 255.
- Each number is added together and then multiplied by 256 * by the position in the array.
